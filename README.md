# AltPooler-Solana-Bundler-Bot
# ALT Pooler

## Overview
The ALT Pooler is designed for those who prefer not to use the complete Bundler bot for generating tokens and creating markets. Instead, they can use web tools for token generation. The ALT Pooler offers a handy alternative for such users.

## What It Does
The ALT Pooler allows you to input token details in the `config.ts` file, such as `tokenAddress` and other necessary details like `decimals`, `LP Amount`, `Liquidity Amount for Tokens`, etc. After configuring, you can run the `altPooler` command to create the usual 3-wallet bundle with custom amounts and wallets of your choice.
